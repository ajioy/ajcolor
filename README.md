Ajioy Vim Python 1.0
=====================

This is my attempt to make the python syntax highlighting in Vim more beautiful

Important
---------

Support Python C/C++

In the syntax folder is the **python.vim** which does the syntax highlighting for Python. Just replace yours with mine
but remember to backup beforehand.

Next I had to add another color definition to the **molokai.vim** stylesheet. This is probably not a very good idea
because the new color definition will not be available for a different color theme. So in your colors folder
add this molokai.vim and remember to select it as your default colorscheme.

General
-------

The additions are still very much a hack job and must be improved upon. I think there are still two issues to 
sort out to duplicate the functionality of the Textmate highlighting, but I guess it is usable.
